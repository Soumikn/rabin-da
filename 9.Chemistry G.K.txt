9.Gobar gas mainly contains Methane.
10.Silver is the highest conductor of elctricity.
11.Dolomite is the ore of Calcium Mangnesium Carbonate.
12.Joint process of vaporisation and condensation is called Evapotranspiration.
13.Berzelius develop a system of chemical notation in which elements were given simple written labels- soch as O for oxigen.
14.Potassium Permanganate is used for purifying drinking water as It is a oxidizing agent.
15.Butane gas is used in cigarette lighter.
16.Due to carbon dioxide, bubbles comes when limestone piece dipped in water.
17.Name given to german silver because it appearance is like silver.In german silver amount of silver is zero.
18.Source of Radon -222 is Uranium 238.
19.Brass is made by the mixture of copper and zinc.
20.Father of periodic table- Mendalif.
21.Hydrogen and helium (also known as lift gas), the lightest two gas weight so little that ballons and hydrogen dirigibles are able to float in atmosphere.
22.Modern periodic table has 118 element.Noble gas group 18. Largest period 6(32 element). Shortest 1 (2 element).
23.Graphene is a allotrope of carbon.
24.Chlorine gas is used for the manufacture of bleaching powder.
25.Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder is represented as CaOCl2.
26.On heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate Caso4 1/2 h20 called Plaster of paris.
27.Freon used as refrigant or used in home refrigrater is chemically known as chlorofluoro carbon(CFC).
28.LPG (Liquified petrolium gas) reffered to as simply propane or butane. It is colourless and odorless. So a small amount of methyle mercaptan(Suphur compound)
    is usually added to make it easy to detect a gas leak.
29.The only non-metal which show the property of lusture(Shinning)-Iodine.
30.Graphite is the only non-metal which is good conductor of elctricity.
31.Nuclear reaction are of two types one is Nuclear Fusion reaction and onother is Fission reaction.
32.In nuclear reactor Sodium liquid is used for heat tranfer medium because sodium has high specific heat.
33.Sun's energy is produced by nuclear fusion reaction.
34.Nuclear fission reaction occurs in nuclear reacter.Fission reaction is also known as chain reaction.
35.On increase of temprature metals conductivity decreases and on decrease of temprature conductivity increases.
36.Value of 1 electreon -1.6 x 10 pow -19 coloumb.
37.To detect the gas leakage Thioethanol(ethyl mercaptan) is added to domestic LPG cylinder.
38.Sulpher(Sulphide) is the chemical which is responsible for the stimulation of tear glands by the onion.
39.Formula of rust Fe203.xH2o (rusting of iron).
40.Nuclear reacter is used to start nuclear reaction.
41.The most commonly used bleaching agent is chlorine.
42.The metallurgical process in which a metal is obtained in a fused state is called smelting.
43.
