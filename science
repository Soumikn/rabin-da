Do you know where honey comes from, or how it is produced? Have you seen a beehive where so many bees keep buzzing about? Bees collect nectar
(sweet juices) from flowers, convert it into honey and store it in their hive.

We know that each dish is usually made up of one or more ingredients, which we get from plants or animals. These ingredients contain some components
that are needed by our body. These components are called nutrients. 

The major nutrients in our food are named carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.

The main carbohydrates found in our food are in the form of starch and sugars.

Foods containing fats and carbohydrates are also called ‘energy giving foods’. Carbohydrates mainly provide energy to our body. Fats also give us energy.
In fact, fats give much more energy as compared to the same amount of carbohydrates.

Proteins are needed for the growth and repair of our body.

Vitamins help in protecting our body against diseases. Vitamins also help in keeping our eyes, bones, teeth and gums healthy.

     Vitamin A -   keeps our skin and eyes healthy. Deficiency disease/Disorder- Loss of vision. 
                        Symptoms-Poor vision, loss of vision in darkness,some time complete loss of vision
                        Ex- Papaya, Carrot, Mango
     ( Vitamin A also known as Anti-infective vitamin, Carotene is the source of Vitamin A in Leafy Vegetable,)

     Vitamin B - Ex- Rice, Wheat

     Vitamin B1- Deficiency disease/Disorder- Beriberi , Symptoms-  Weak muscles and very little energy to work
      ( Vitamin B1 present in Unpolished Rice,

      Vitamin C- Deficiency disease/Disorder- Scurvy, Symptoms- Bleeding gums, wounds take longer time to heal  helps body to fight against many diseases.
                       Vitamin C gets easily destroyed by heat during cooking. Ex- Vegetable
       (Vitamin C  helps to cure wound, immunity of body, first synthesized vitamin)

      Vitamin D- Deficiency disease/Disorder-Rickets, Symptoms- Bones become soft and bend.  Helps our body to use calcium for bones and teeth. Ex- Fish, Egg, Butter

      Vitamin K - Helps in blood clotting

      Calcium- Deficiency disease/Disorder- Bone and tooth decay, Symptoms- Weak bones and tooth decay

      Iodine- Deficiency disease/Disorder- Goiter,  Symptoms- Glands in the neck appears swollen, mental disabilty in children
 
      Iron- Deficiency disease/Disorder- Anaemia, Symptoms- Weakness

      Note: Vitamin C and B complex are water soluble. Vitamin A D E K are fat soluble.

Rice has more carbohydrates than other nutrients. Thus, we say that rice is a “carbohydrate rich” source of food.

Besides these nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres are also known as roughage. Roughage is mainly provided by plant products in our foods. 
   Whole grains and pulses, potatoes, fresh fruits and vegetables are main sources of roughage.

Water helps our body to absorb nutrients from food. It also helps in throwing out some wastes from body as urine and sweat. 

It can be very harmful for us to eat too much of fat rich foods and we may end up suffering from a condition called obesity.

Synthetic fibres- Some examples of synthetic fibres are polyester, nylon and acrylic.

The process of making yarn from fibres is called spinning. Government of India constituted a body called Khadi and Village Industries Commission in 1956.

Rice or pulses are usually washed before cooking. When you add water to these, the impurities like dust particles get separated. These impurities go into
  water. Now, what will sink to the bottom of the vessel — rice or dust? Why? Have you seen that the vessel is tilted to pour out the dirty water?
  When the heavier component in a mixture settles after water is added to it, the process is called sedimentation.
  When the water (along with the dust) is removed, the process is called decantation.

The process of conversion of water into its vapour is called evaporation. The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid form is called condensation.

After adding a few spoons of salt, do you find that some salt remains undissolved and settles at the bottom of the beaker? If yes, this means that
  no more salt can be dissolved in the amount of water we have taken. The solution is now said to be saturated.

Landfill is an area where the garbage collected from a city or town is dumped. The area is later converted into a park.

Converting plant and animal waste including that from kitchen, into manure, is called composting.

The method of making compost from kitchen garbage using redworms is called vermicomposting.

Plants are the only organisms that can prepare food for themselves by using water, carbon dioxide and minerals.

The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture.

Life history of silk moth -> The female silk moth lays eggs ->from which hatch larvae which are called caterpillars or silkworms->
                                        They grow in size and when the caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of its life history called pupa

The normal temperature of human body is 37°C.

Hetrophylly is the term used for occurence of more than one type of morphologically different leaves on the same plant.

You must have heard of the ozone layer in our atmosphere. It protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation which come from the sun. Ozone absorbs this
  radiation and breaks down to oxygen. Oxygen is different from ozone. 

A cyclone is known by different names in different parts of the world. It is called a ‘hurricane’ in the American continent. In Philippines and Japan it is called a ‘typhoon’.

The instrument that measures the wind speed is called an anemometer.

Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling. As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler air moves to that place.

SOIL PROFILING (Layers of soil) AND TYPES

  The rotting dead matter in the soil is called humus.A vertical section through different layers of the soil is called the soil profile. Each layer differs in feel (texture),
    colour, depth and chemical composition. These layers are referred to as horizons.  The mixture of rock particles and humus is called the soil.
  
  The uppermost horizon is generally dark in colour as it is rich in humus and minerals. The humus makes the soil fertile and provides nutrients to
      growing plants. This layer is generally soft, porous and can retain more water. It is called the topsoil or the A-horizon.
  
  The next layer has a lesser amount of humus but more of minerals. This layer is generally harder and more compact and is called the B-horizon or the middle layer.

  The third layer is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of rocks with cracks and crevices.

   Lowest layer of soil is Bedrock  which is hard and difficult to dig with a spade.

   The soil is classified on the basis of the proportion of particles of various sizes. If soil contains greater proportion of big particles it is called sandy soil.
    If the proportion of fine particles is relatively higher, then it is called clayey soil. If the amount of large and fine particles is about the same, then
     the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil can be classified as sandy, clayey and loamy.

  The best topsoil for growing plants is loamy. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
    in river beds. The size of the silt particles is between those of sand and clay. The loamy soil also has humus in it. It has the right water holding capacity for the
    growth of plants.

  On a hot summer day, the vapour coming out of the soil reflect the sunlight and the air above the soil seems to shimmer.

   Percolation rate of water is different in different types of soil. It is highest in the sandy soil and least in the clayey soil.

The number of times a person breathes in a minute is termed as the "breathing rate". 

 HOW DO WE BREATHE?

 Normally we take in air through our nostrils. When we inhale air, it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity, the air reaches our lungs through the
  windpipe. Lungs are present in the chest cavity. This cavity is surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large, muscular sheet called diaphragm forms
  the floor of the chest cavity. Breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and the rib cage.

 The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust, pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our
   nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the nasal cavity. Then they irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we
   sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dustfree, clean air enters our body.

If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the respiration is called anaerobic respiration.

ACID BASE AND SALT

Special type of substances are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic. These substances are known as indicators. The indicators change their
  colour when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance. Turmeric, litmus, china rose petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the naturally occurring indicators.

 Name of Acid                                              Found In
  Acetic Acid                                       -----    Vinegar
  Formic Acid                                     -----    Ant sting
  Citric Acid                                       ------   Orange, Lemon etc.
  Lactic Acid                                      ------   Curd
  Oxalic Acid                                     ------   Spinach
  Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)               ------   Amla (rich in vitamin C) and all Citrus Fruit.
  Tartaric  Acid                                   -----    Tamarind, grapes, unripe mangoes etc.

 Name of Bases                                                     Found In
  Calcium hydroxide                                      -------  Lime water
  Ammonium hydroxide                                  -------  Window cleaner
  Sodium hydroxide/Potassium hydroxide       -------  Soap
  Magnesium hydroxide                                  -------  Milk of magnesia

The rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to 
   form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings, historical monuments, plants and animals.

When an acidic solution is mixed with a basic solution, both the solutions neutralise the effect of each other. When an acid solution and a base solution are
  mixed in suitable amounts, both the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature of the base are destroyed. The resulting solution is neither acidic nor
  basic. Touch the test tube immediately after neutralisation. What do you observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat is always produced, or evolved. The
  evolved heat raises the temperature of the reaction mixture.

The reaction between an acid and a base is known as neutralisation. Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat.
   Acid + Base  →   Salt + Water (Heat is evolved)

Properties such as shape, size, colour and state of a substance are called its physical properties. A change in which a substance undergoes a change in its
  physical properties is called a physical change. A physical change is generally reversible. In such a change no new substance is formed

 RUSTING OF IRON

   Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2, from the air) + water (H2O) → rust (iron oxide Fe2O3)
   
  For rusting, the presence of both oxygen and water (or water vapour) is essential. 
  In fact, if the content of moisture in air is high, which means if it is more humid, rusting becomes faster.

  So, how do we prevent rusting?
    Deposit a layer of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.This process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation.

 Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese. It does not rust.

The warm air is, therefore, lighter than the cold air. That is the reason that the smoke goes up.
 
The warm air at these latitudes rises up and the cold wind from the polar regions rushes in, to take its place. In this way, wind circulation is set up from the poles to
   the warmer latitudes

Physics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motion in a straight line is called rectilinear motion.
In circular motion an object moves such that its distance from a fixed point remains the same.
Motion that repeats itself after some period of time is called periodic motion.

An electric bulb may fuse due to many reasons. One reason for a bulb to fuse is a break in its filament. A break in the filament of an electric bulb means
  a break in the path of the current between the terminals of the electric cell.

A switch is a simple device that either breaks the circuit or completes it. 

The materials which get attracted towards a magnet are magnetic – for example, iron, nickel or cobalt. The materials which are not attracted towards a magnet are non-magnetic. 

 All magnets have two poles whatever their shape may be. Usually, north (N) and south (S) poles are marked on the magnets.

HEAT
-------

Heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. The process by which heat is transferred from the hotter end to the colder end of an object is known as conduction.

The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are conductors of heat. For examples, aluminum, iron and copper. The materials which do not allow heat to
 pass through them easily are poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood. Poor conductors are known as insulators.The water and air are poor conductors of heat. 

When water is heated (beaker can be used, Filled with two-thirds with water) which can be heat it by placing a candle below it. When water is heated, the water near the flame gets
  hot. Hot water rises up. The cold water from the sides moves down towards the source of heat. This water also gets hot and rises and water from the sides moves down.
  This process continues till the whole water gets heated. This mode of heat transfer is known as "Convection".

How does the heat travel in air? In which direction does the smoke go? The air near the heat source gets hot and rises. The air from the sides comes in to take its place.

From the sun the heat comes to us by another process known as radiation.

In the winter, we use woollen clothes. Wool is a poor conductor of heat. Moreover, there is air trapped in between the wool fibres. This air prevents the flow
  of heat from our body to the cold surroundings. So, we feel warm.

The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
   object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.

In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required for transfer of heat by radiation

Biology
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plants with weak stems that cannot stand upright but spread on the ground are called creepers  while those that take support and climb up are called
 climbers. These are different from the herbs, shrubs and trees.

Leaf - The part of leaf by which it is attached to the stem is called petiole. 
          The broad, green part of the leaf is called lamina.
          Lines on the leaf are called veins.
          Do you see a prominent line in the middle of the leaf? This is called the midrib. The design made by veins in a leaf is called the leaf venation.
          If this design is net-like on both sides of midrib, the venation is reticulate. In the leaves of grass you might have seen that the veins are parallel to one another. This is parallel venation.

Transpiration - Use a healthy, well watered plant that has been growing in the sun. Enclose a leafy branch of the plant in a polythene cover and tie up its mouth.
                       After a few hours, observe the inner surface of the covers. What do you see? Are there any droplets of water?
                       Water comes out of leaves in the form of vapour by a process called transpiration. Plants release a lot of water into the air through this process.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS — FOOD MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS

  Leaves are the food factories of plants. The synthesis of food in plants occurs in leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials must reach there. Water and
  minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves. Carbon dioxide from air is taken in through the tiny pores present on the
  surface of the leaves. These pores are surrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores are called stomata.

  The leaves have a green pigment called chlorophyll. It helps leaves to capture the energy of the sunlight. This energy is used to synthesise (prepare)
    food from carbon dioxide and water. Since the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it is called photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis :
    to combine). So we find that chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis. It is a unique process
    on the earth. The solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plant in the form of food. Thus, sun is the ultimate source of energy for all
    living organisms. Plants synthesise carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis.

   The carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. These are used to synthesise other components of food such as proteins and fats. But proteins
     are nitrogenous substances which contain nitrogen.

    Nitrogen is present in abundance in gaseous form in the air. However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen in this form. Soil has certain bacteria that
     convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable form and release it into the soil. These soluble forms are  are absorbed by the plants along with water. 
  
  Leaves prepare their food in the presence of sunlight and a green coloured substance present in them. For this, they also use water and carbon dioxide. This process is
   called photosynthesis.  Oxygen is given out in this process. 
  
  Plants absorb mineral nutrients from the soil.So,their amounts in the soil keep on declining.Fertilisers & manures contain plant nutrients such as nitrogen,potassium,phosphorous,etc. 
    Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen to make proteins.

 Plants cannot use nitrogen in the manner they can use carbon dioxide. They need nitrogen in a soluble form. The bacterium called Rhizobium and Azetobactor can
   take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a soluble form as nitrate. But Rhizobium cannot make its own food. So it lives in the roots of gram, peas, moong, beans 
   and other legumes and provides them with nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals) are obtained from leguminous plants.

  Cynobacteria is a nitrogen fixing Algae.


PARTS OF FLOWER- 
         
        Petals, Sepals, Pistil (The innermost part of flower is called the pistil, It contains Ovary, Style, Stigma), 
        Stamens (also known as male reproductive parts of flower) (Parts of Stamen - Filament, Anther)

DIFFRENT TYPE OF JOINTS, BONES IN BODY

	Pivotal Joint- The joint where our neck joins the head is a pivotal joint. It allows us to bend our head forward and backward and turn the head to our right or left.

	Hinge Joint -  The elbow has a hinge joint that allows only a back and forth movement.

	Fixed joint-  The bones cannot move at these joints. Such joints are called fixed joints.  

	Chest bone and the backbone together to form a box. This is called the rib cage. There are 12 ribs on each side of chest.

 	Backbone- It is made up of many small bones called vertebrae. The backbone consists of 33 vertebrae.

 	Pelvic bones- They enclose the portion of your body below the stomach. This is the part you sit on.

 	Cartilage - You do feel something in the upper parts of the ear that is not as soft as the ear lobe but, not as hard as a bone, isn’t it? This is cartilage

	Earthworm does not have bones. It has muscles which help to extend and shorten the body. 

The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. The habitats of plants and animals that live in water are called aquatic habitats.

There are some changes that can happen in an organism over a short period of time to help them adjust to some changes in their surroundings. For instance,
   if we live in the plains and suddenly go to high mountain regions, we may experience difficulty in breathing and doing physical exercise for some days.
   We need to breathe faster when we are on high mountains. After some days, our body adjusts to the changed conditions on the high mountain. Such small
   changes that take place in the body of a single organism over short periods, to overcome small problems due to changes in the surroundings, are called acclimatisation.

Do plants also respire? Exchange of gases in plants mainly takes place through leaves. The leaves take in air through tiny pores in them and use the oxygen. 
   They give out carbon dioxide to the air. We learnt that in sunlight, plants use carbon dioxide to produce food and give out oxygen. The amount of oxygen
    released in the process of food preparation by plants is much more than the oxygen they use in respiration. Respiration in plants takes place day and night.

All of us respond immediately to changes. Changes in our surroundings that makes us respond to them, are called stimuli.

The mode of nutrition in which organisms make food themselves from simple substances is called autotrophic nutrition. Therefore, plants are called autotrophs.
Animals and most other organisms take in ready made food prepared by the plants. They are called heterotrophs.

Cell -  The cell is enclosed by a thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane.
          Most cells have a distinct, centrally located spherical structure called the nucleus.
          The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like substance called cytoplasm.

Insect-eating plants are called insectivorous plants.

Fungi -- Most probably you will see cotton-like threads spread on the piece of bread. These organisms are called fungi.They have a different mode of nutrition.
             They secrete digestive juices on the dead and decaying matter and convert it into a solution. They secrete digestive juices on the dead
              and decaying matter and convert it into a solution. Then they absorb the nutrients from it. This mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients in
              solution form from dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition. Plants which use saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs.

Symbiotic relationship-  Some organisms live together and share shelter and nutrients. This is called symbiotic relationship. For example, certain fungi live in the roots of trees. 
                                    The tree provides nutrients to the fungus and, in return, receives help from it to take up water and nutrients from the soil. 
                                    This association is very important for the tree.

In organisms called lichens, a chlorophyll-containing partner, which is an alga, and a fungus live together.The fungus provides shelter, water and
   minerals to the alga and, in return, the alga provides food which it prepares by photosynthesis.


 DIGESTION IN HUMANS
  
The process of taking food into the body is called ingestion. Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The digestion of protein starts in the stomach.

Starch - A complex carbohydrate found chiefly in seeds, fruits, tubers, roots and stem pith of plants, notably in corn, potatoes, wheat, and rice.

  Have you ever wondered what happens to the food inside the body? The food passes through a continuous canal  which begins at the buccal avity and
    ends at the anus. The canal can be divided into various compartments: These parts together form the alimentary canal (digestive tract).
         (1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small intestine, (5) large intestine ending in the rectum and (6) the anus. 

   The inner walls of the stomach and the small intestine, and the various glands associated with the canal such as salivary glands, the liver
     and the pancreas secrete digestive juices.The digestive juices convert complex substances of food into simpler ones. The
     digestive tract and the associated glands together constitute the digestive system.

 The saliva breaks down the starch into sugars.

Functions of the tongue?
    We use our tongue for talking. Besides, it mixes saliva with the food during chewing and helps in swallowing food.
    We also taste food with our tongue. It has taste buds that detect different tastes of food.

Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough, get hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
  windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
  Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
   food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel choked, get hiccups or cough.

The stomach--

The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its shape is like a flattened U and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal. It receives food from the food pipe at one
 end and opens into the small intestine at the other.The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive juices. The mucous protects
 the lining of the stomach. The acid kills many bacteria that enter along with the food and makes the medium in the stomach acidic and helps the digestive
 juices to act. The digestive juices break down the proteins into simpler substances.

The small intestine
-- The small intestine is highly coiled and is about 7.5 metres long. It receives secretions from the liver and the pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes juices.

Liver --The liver is a reddish brown gland situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side. It is the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
          juice that is stored in a sac called the gall bladder. The bile plays an important role in the digestion of fats.

The pancreas is a large cream coloured gland located just below the stomach. The pancreatic juice acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins and changes them into simpler forms. 

The partly digested food now reaches the lower part of the small intestine where the intestinal juice completes the digestion of all components of the food.
   The carbohydrates get broken into simple sugars such as glucose, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids.

Absorption in the small intestine -- The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine. This process is called absorption. The
                                                     inner walls of the small intestine have thousands of finger-like outgrowths. These are called villi (singular villus).
                                                     Can you guess what the role of villi could be in the intestine? The villi increase the surface area for absorption of the
                                                     digested food. Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface. The surface of the villi
                                                     absorbs the digested food materials. The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs
                                                     of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the
 proteins required by the body. This is called assimilation.

Large Intestine -- The food that remains undigested and unabsorbed enters into the large intestine.The large intestine is wider and shorter than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
                           in length.  Its function is to absorb water and some salts from the undigested food material. The remaining waste passes into the rectum and remains there as
                           semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is removed through the anus from time-to-time. This is called egestion.

DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING ANIMALS

Have you observed cows, buffaloes and other grass-eating animals chewing continuously even when they are not eating? Actually, they quickly swallow the grass and store
   it in a part of the stomach called rumen. Here the food gets partially digested and is called cud. But later the cud returns to the mouth in small lumps and the animal chews
   it. This process is called rumination and these animals are called ruminants.

The grass is rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate. Many animals, including humans, cannot digest cellulose.

FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN AMOEBA

  Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled organism found in pond water. Amoeba has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense nucleus and many small bubble-like
    vacuoles in its cytoplasm. Amoeba constantly changes its shape and position. It pushes out one, or more finger-like projections, called pseudopodia or false feet for movement
    and capture of food.


In the cell, the food (glucose) is broken down into carbon dioxide and water using oxygen. When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called
  aerobic respiration. Food can also be broken down, without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. Breakdown of food releases energy.

The taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body is called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide is known as exhalation.


Banana is a plant that form fruit but no seed. Pinus a plant that form seed but not fruit.
