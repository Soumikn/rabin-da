42.If we continiously add salt in water and when no more salt can be dissolved in the amount of water we have taken. The solution is now said to be saturated. 
43.More of a substance can be dissolved in a solution by heating it.
44.Most plants can be classified into three categories: herbs, shrubs and trees.  
45.Plants with weak stems that cannot stand upright but spread on the ground are called creepers  while those that take support and climb up are called climbers
46. Leaf (The part of leaf by which it is attached to the stem is called petiole , The broad, green part of the leaf is called lamina,
               The lines on the leaf are called veins, The middle line of the leaf is called midrib,  The design made by veins in a leaf is called the leaf venation,
                If the design is net-like on both sides of midrib, the venation is reticulate  )       
47. In the leaves of grass you might have seen that the veins are parallel to one another. This is parallel venation .
48.Water comes out of leaves in the form of vapour by a process called transpiration. Plants release a lot of water into the air through this process. 
49.Leaves prepare their food in the presence of sunlight and a green coloured substance present in them. For this, they also use water and carbon dioxide. This process is
    called photosynthesis. Oxygen is given out in this process.
50.Flower Parts ( open part is called petals, petals are covered with sepals when it is a bud, middle portion is Pistil(inside pistil we have stigma,style,Ovary,
                          Stamin(inside stamin there is filament), Anthers, ).
51.The joint where our neck joins the head is a pivotal joint. It allows us to bend our head forward and backward and turn the head to our right or left.
52.The elbow has a hinge joint that allows only a back and forth movement.
53. The bones cannot move at these joints. Such joints are called fixed joints.There is a joint between the upper jaw and the rest of the head which is a fixed joint.
54.The human skeleton is composed of around 305 bones at birth. The number of bones in the skeleton changes with age. It decreases to 206 bones by adulthood 
     after some bones have fused together.
55.We see that the ribs are curiously bent. They join the chest bone and the backbone together to form a box. This is called the rib cage. 
56.There are 12 ribs on each side of chest. 
57.Backbone is made up of many small bones called vertebrae. Backbone consist of 33 vertebrae.
58.Upper part of ear has cartilage.
59.An earthworm does not have bones. It has muscles which help to extend and shorten the body.
60.The head and tail of the fish are smaller than the middle portion of the body ñ the body tapers at both ends. This body shape is called streamlined.
61.The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats.
62.Small changes that take place in the body of a single organism over short periods, to overcome small problems due to changes in the surroundings, are called acclimatisation.

69.Unit of length is metre.
70.Objects move along a straight line. This type of motion is called rectilinear motion.
71.Take a stone, tie a thread to it and whirl it with your hand. Observe the motion of the stone. We see that the stone moves along a circular path. 
     This type of motion is called circular motion.
72.In some cases, an object repeats its motion after some time. This type of motion is called periodic motion.
73.Objects like the sun that give out or emit light of their own are called luminous objects.
74.We all use mirrors at home. You look into the mirror and see your own face inside the mirror. What you see is a reflection of your face in the mirror.
75.Light travels in straight line.
76. The thin wire that gives off light is called the filament of the bulb.
77.Materials which allow electric current to pass through them are conductors of electricity.Insulators do not allow electric current to pass through them.
78.Human body is a conductor of electricity.
79.Switch is a simple device that is used to either break the electric circuit or to complete it.
80.Rocks which behave as magnet are natural magnet.Such rocks were given the name magnetite.Magnetite contains iron.
81.The substances having the property of attracting iron are now known as magnets. 
82.The materials which get attracted towards a magnet are magnetic ñ for example, iron, nickel or cobalt. The materials which are not attracted towards a magnet are non-magnetic.
83.All magnets have two poles whatever their shape may be. Usually, north (N) and south (S) poles are marked on the magnets.
84.A freely suspended magnet always aligns in N-S direction.
85.Opposite poles of two magnets attract each other whereas similar poles repel one another.
86.Component of air, which supports burning, is known as oxygen.
87.The major part of air (which does not support burning candle) is nitrogen when we cover buring candle with a glass.
88. Plants also consume oxygen for respiration, but they produce more of it than they consume. That is why we say plants produce oxygen.
89.Air in motion is called wind.Air occupies space.
90.Safai karamcharis collect the garbage in trucks and take it to a low lying open area, called a landfill.
91.In some cities and towns, municipalities provide separate dustbins for collecting two kinds of garbage. Usually one is coloured blue and the other green. 
     The blue bin is for materials that can be used again ó such as plastics, metals and glass. The green bins are for collecting kitchen and other plant or animal wastes.
92.Earthworms are called farmerís friend.
93.The Prime Minister of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).The aim of this mission is to create an open defecation-free India by 2 October 2019.
94.Converting plant and animal waste including that from kitchen, into manure, is called composting.
95.The method of making compost from kitchen garbage using redworms is called vermicomposting.
96.The mode of nutrition in which organisms make food themselves from simple substances is called autotrophic. Therefore, plants are called autotrophs.
97.Animals and most other organisms take in ready made food prepared by the plants. They are called heterotrophs.
98.Leaves are the food factories of plants. The synthesis of food in plants occurs in leaves.
99. Bodies of living organisms are made of tiny units called cells.
100.The cell is enclosed by a thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane. Most cells have a distinct, centrally located spherical structure called the nucleus
       The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like substance called cytoplasm.
101. Water and minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves. Carbon dioxide from air is taken in through the tiny pores present on the
          surface of the leaves. These pores are surrounded by ëguard cellsí. Such pores are called stomata.
102.The leaves have a green pigment called  chlorophyll. It helps leaves to capture the energy of the sunlight. This energy is used to synthesise (prepare)
       food from carbon dioxide and water. Since the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it is called photosynthesis.
103. So we find that chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis.
104. Photosynthesis  is a unique process on the earth. The solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plant in the form of food. Thus, sun is
       the ultimate source of energy for all living organisms.
105.During photosynthesis, chlorophyll containing cells of leaves, in the presence of sunlight, use carbon dioxide and water to synthesise carbohydrates + oxygen.
106. During photosynthesis, The carbohydrates ultimately get converted into starch. The presence of starch in leaves indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis. 
       The starch is also a carbohydrate.
107.You often see slimy, green patches in ponds or in other stagnant water bodies. These are generally formed by the growth of organisms called algae.
      Can you guess why algae are green in colour? They contain chlorophyll which gives them the green colour. Algae can also prepare their own food by photosynthesis.
108. Insect-eating plants are called insectivorous plants.
109.Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen to make proteins. After the harvest, the soil becomes deficient in nitrogen.
110.Plant need need nitrogen in a soluble form. The bacterium called Rhizobium can take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a soluble form.
111.The food passes in human body through a continuous canal which begins at the buccal cavity and ends at the anus.
112.The human food canal can be divided into various compartments:
       (1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small intestine, (5) large intestine ending in the rectum and (6) the anus.
113.The process of taking food into the body is called ingestion.
114. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs.
115.The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its shape is like a flattened U and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal.
116.The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive juices.
117.The small intestine is highly coiled and is about 7.5 metres long.
118.The liver is a reddish brown gland situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side. It is the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
       juice that is stored in a sac called the gall bladder. The bile plays an important role in the digestion of fats.
119.The food that remains undigested and unabsorbed enters into the large intestine.
120.The large intestine is wider and shorter than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre in length. Its function is to absorb water and some salts from the undigested food material.
121.Cows, buffaloes and other grass-eating animals chewing continuously even when they are not eating? Actually, they quickly swallow the grass and store it in a part of 
      the stomach called rumen. Here the food get partially digest and is called cud.But later the cud returns to the mouth in small lumps and the animal chews it. 
      This process is called rumination and these animals are called ruminants.
122.Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS).
123.The grass is rich in cellulose, a type of carbohydrate.
124.Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled organism found in pond water.
125.Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia. The food is digested in the food vacuole.
126.The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture.
127.China leads the world in silk production.
128.Silk comes from silkworms and wool is obtained from sheep, goat and yak. Hence silk and wool are animal fibres.
129.Temperature is measured by a device called thermometer.
130.The normal temperature of human body is 37∞C.
131. Heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object.
132.The process by which heat is transferred from the hotter end to the colder end of an object is known as conduction.
133.From the sun the heat comes to us by another process known as radiation.
134.The transfer of heat by radiation does not require any medium.
135.There are three ways in which heat can flow from one object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.
136.In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required for transfer of heat by radiation.
137.Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.
138.Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and vinegar taste sour. These substances taste sour because they contain acids.
139. Substances like these which are bitter in taste and feel soapy on touching are known as bases. The nature of such substances is said to be basic.
140.Special type of substances are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic. These substances are known as indicators. The indicators change their
        colour when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance. 
141.Acetic acid Vinegar,Formic acid Antís sting,Citric acid-(oranges,lemons),Lactic acid -Curd,Tartaric acid-(Tamarind, grapes, unripe mangoes, etc).
142.When litmus When added to an acidic solution, it turns red and when added to a basic solution, it turns blue.
143.The solutions which do not change the colour of either red or blue litmus are known as neutral solutions. These substances are neither acidic nor basic.
144.Acid turn blue litmus to red and base turn red litmus to blue.
145.The reaction between an acid and a base is known as neutralisation. Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat.
              Acid + Base ------>Salt+ water (Heat is evolved)
146.Each cell in our body contains an acid, the deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.
147.If you leave a piece of iron in the open for some time, it acquires a film of brownish substance. This substance is called rust and the process is called rusting.
148.When carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, calcium carbonate is formed, which makes lime water milky.
149.For rusting, the presence of both oxygen and water (or water vapour) is essential.
150.This process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation.
151.Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese. It does not rust.
152.Rainfall is measured by an instrument called the rain gauge.
153.All changes in the weather are caused by the sun.
154.Tropical rainforests are found in Western Ghats and Assam in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and Central Africa. Because of continuous
       warmth and rain, this region supports wide variety of plants and animals.
155.Also, it is important to remember that on heating the air expands and occupies more space. When the same thing occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
      The warm air is, therefore, lighter than the cold air. That is the reason that the smoke goes up.
156.A cyclone is known by different names in different parts of the world. It is called a ëhurricaneí in the American continent. In Philippines and Japan it is called a ëtyphooní.
157.Largest gland- Liver 
158.soil is formed by the breaking down of rocks by the action of wind, water and climate.This process is called weathering.
159.Clayey soil is used to make pots, toys and statues.
160.You should know that there are some organisms such as yeast that can survive in the absence of air. They are called anaerobes.
161.The number of times a person breathes in a minute is termed as the breathing rate.
162.During breathing inhalation and exhalation take place alternately. A breath means one inhalation plus one exhalation.
163.Though frogs have a pair of lungs like human beings, they can also breathe through their skin, which is moist and slippery.
164. Leaves of the plants have tiny pores called stomata for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
165.In earthworm, the exchange of gases occurs through the moist skin. In fishes it takes place through gills and in insects through the tracheae.
166.Blood is the fluid which flows in blood vessels.
167.The fluid part of the blood is called plasma.
168.One type of cells are the red blood cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment called haemoglobin.The presence of haemoglobin makes blood appear red.
169.The blood also has white blood cells (WBC) which fight against germs that may enter our body.
170.Suppose from your body Blood was coming out from the cut. After some time, you noticed that bleeding had stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
      the cut. You get puzzled about this. The clot is formed because of the presence of another type of cells in the blood, called platelets.
171.Two types of blood vessels, arteries and veins are present in the body.
172.Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
173.The number of beats per minute is called the pulse rate.
174.Veins are the vessels which carry carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
175. Heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
176.The English physician, William Harvey discovered the circulation of blood.
178.The waste which is present in the blood has to be removed from the body. How can this be done? A mechanism to filter the blood is required. This is done by
      the blood capillaries in the kidneys. Arteries divide into smaller vessels. On reaching the tissues, they divide further into extremely thin tubes called capillaries. 
      The capillaries join up to form veins which empty into the heart.
179.Sometimes a personÌs kidneys may stop working due to infection or injury. As a result of kidney failure, waste products start accumulating in the blood. Such persons 
        cannot survive unless their blood is filtered periodically through an artificial kidney. This process is called dialysis.
180.Plants have pipe-like vessels to transport water and nutrients from the soil. The vessels are made of special cells, forming the vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
      cells that perform specialised function in an organism. The vascular tissue for the transport of water and nutrients in the plant is called the xylem.
181.You know that leaves synthesise food. The food has to be transported to all parts of the plant. This is done by the vascular tissue called the phloem.
       Thus, xylem and phloem transport substances in plants.
182.Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
183.Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
184. The flowers perform the function of reproduction in plants. Flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant.
185.Most plants have roots, stems and leaves. These are called the vegetative parts of a plant.
186.Asexual reproduction in which new plants are produced from roots, stems, leaves and buds. Since reproduction is through the vegetative parts of the plant, it is known as
       vegetative propagation.
187.Remember that yeast is a single-celled organism.
188.Flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant. The stamens are the male reproductive part and the pistil is the female reproductive part.
189.The flowers which contain either only the pistil or only the stamens are called unisexual flowers. The flowers which contain both stamens and pistil
        are called bisexual flowers. Corn, papaya and cucumber produce unisexual flowers, whereas mustard, rose and petunia have bisexual flowers.
190. In sexual reproduction in flower a male and a female gamete fuse(add together) to form a zygote, process is called fertilization.The zygote develops into an embryo.
191. The transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of a flower is called pollination.
192.  If soil contains greater proportion of big particles it is called sandy soil. If the proportion of fine particles is relatively higher, then it is called
         clayey soil. If the amount of large and fine particles is about the same, then the soil is called loamy.
193. speed is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken.
194.In everyday life we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long durations of time. If the speed of an object moving along
       a straight line keeps changing, its motion is said to be non-uniform. On the other hand, an object moving along a straight line with a constant speed
       is said to be in uniform motion.
195.The to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of a periodic or an oscillatory motion.
196.The basic unit of time is a second.
197.unit of speed is m/s.
198.In car dashboard there are two device. One which measure speed is called a speedometer.There is also another meter that measures the distance moved by the vehicle.
      This meter is known as an odometer.
199.Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)
200. A fuse is thus a safety device which prevents damages to electrical circuits and possible fires.
201.These days Miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) are increasingly being used in place of fuses.
202.When an electric current flows through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
203.An image formed by a plane mirror is erect and of the same size as the object.
204.If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror.
205.Can you now recognise the mirrors used as side mirrors in scooters? These are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can form images of objects spread over a large
      area. So, these help the drivers to see the traffic behind them.
206.A convex lens converges (bends inward) the light generally falling on it. Therefore, it is called a converging lens. On the other hand, a concave lens diverges 
      (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens.
207.The micro-organisms which convert the dead plants and animals to humus are known as decomposers.
208.Sewage is wastewater released by homes, industries, hospitals, offices and other users.
209.Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.
210. Two broad cropping patterns can be identified. These are:
          (i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally from June to September.
                                      Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops.
         (ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the winter season (October to March) are called rabi crops. 
                                   Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed.
211.Paddy requires a lot of water. Therefore, it is grown only in the rainy season.
212.The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called tilling or ploughing.
213.The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients for the healthy growth of plants are called manure and fertilisers.
214.In a field many other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called weeds.
215.Microorganisms are classified into four major groups. These groups are bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some algae.
216. Common ailments like cold, influenza (flu) and most coughs are caused by viruses. Serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses.
217.Diseases like dysentery and malaria are caused by protozoa(protozoans) whereas typhoid and tuberculosis (TB) are bacterial diseases.
218.Curd contains several microorganisms. Of these, the bacterium, Lactobacillus promotes the formation of curd.
219.This process of conversion of sugar into alcohol is known as fermentation. Louis Pasteur discovered fermentation in 1857.
220.Edward Jenner discovered the vaccine for smallpox in 1798.
221.Microorganisms are harmful in many ways. Some of the microorganisms cause diseases in human beings, plants and animals. 
       Such disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens.
222.There are some insects and animals which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such carrier. 
223.Another example of a carrier is the female Anopheles mosquito, which carries the parasite of malaria (Plasmodium).
224.Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier of dengue virus.

460.Epidermal cells of the roots, whose function is water absorption, commonly bear long hairlike parts that greatly increase the total absorptive surface area.
461.During breathing we inhale oxygen. Where does this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the lungs and then is transported to all the body cells through blood.
462. Blood is a type of connective tissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue.Bone is another example of a connective tissue.
463.Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called plasma, in which red blood corpuscles (RBCs), white blood corpuscles (WBCs) and platelets are suspended. 
      The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones and waste materials to different parts of the body.
464.Bone cells are embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds.
465.Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament.
466.Another type of connective tissue, cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid matrix is composed of proteins and sugars. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints
       and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our arms.
467. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility.
468.Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, around blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marrow.
469.Where are fats stored in our body? Fat storing adipose tissue is found below the skin and between internal organs. The cells of this tissue are filled with fat globules. 
      Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator.
470.Muscular tissue consists of elongated cells, also called muscle fibres. This tissue is responsible for movement in our body.
471.Muscles present in our limbs move when we want them to, and stop when we so decide. Such muscles are called voluntary muscles.
472. The brain, spinal cord and nerves are all composed of the nervous tissue. The cells of this tissue are called nerve cells or neurons.
473.The signal that passes along the nerve fibre is called a nerve impulse. Nerve impulses allow us to move our muscles when we want to.
474.Plant tissues are of two main types ñ meristematic and permanent.
475.Parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma are three types of simple tissues. Xylem and phloem are types of complex tissues.

479.The SI unit of speed is metre per second. This is represented by the symbol m sñ1 or m/s.
480.Average speed= Total distance travelled/ Total time taken.
481.The rate of motion of an object can be more comprehensive if we specify its direction of motion along with its speed. The quantity that
       specifies both these aspects is called velocity. Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction.
482.Speed and velocity have the same units, that is m/s.
483. The SI unit of acceleration is m/ s pow 2.
484.The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion.
485.The velocity of an object can be uniform or variable. It can be changed by changing the objectís speed, direction of motion or both.
486.If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be
       uniform. The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. 
487.When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.
488.The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time, and velocity is the displacement per unit time.
489.The motion of an object could be uniform or non-uniform depending on whether its velocity is constant or changing.
490.By Centrifugation process we can make butter from curd.
491.Gravitational force exerted on a mass, called Weight.
492.If an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.
493.Friction always act in a direction opposite to the push.
494.Laws of Motion given by Newton-
                 1.An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force.Also known as Law of Inertia.
                 2.The second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of force
                 3. To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
495. Tendency of undisturbed objects to stay at rest or to keep moving with the same velocity is called inertia.
496.When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to continue in
       our straight-line motion. When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motorcar, we slip to one side of the seat due
       to the inertia of our body.
497. Heavier or more massive objects offer larger inertia.
498.Zacharias janseen invented micrscope.
499.o negative blood grup is the universal doner.
500.Purest form of carbon is Fullerene( Shape of spherical hollow cage like a soccer ball with 60 carbon atom).
501. The inertia of an object is measured by its mass.
502. Momentum was introduced by Newton.
503.Impact produced by the objects depends on their mass and velocity.
504. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram-metre per second (kg m/s). P = mv (mass x velocity)
505. The SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m/s respectively.
506.The unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton, which has the symbol N.
507.Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter, feeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry.

509.Growing two or more crops in definite row patterns is known as inter-cropping.
510.Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land.
511.Some diseases last for only very short periods of time, and these are called acute diseases. Other ailments can last for a long time, even as much as a lifetime, and are
        called chronic diseases. 
512. Diseases like typhoid ,fever, cholera, tuberculosis and anthrax are caused by bacteria.
513.The antibiotic penicillin blocks the bacterial processes that build the cellwall.
514.The motion of the moon around the earth is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of the earth.
515. All objects in the universe attract each other. This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force.
516.The value of G was found out by Henry Cavendish (1731 ñ 1810) by using a sensitive balance. The accepted value of G is 6.673 ◊ 10 pow ñ11 N m pow 2  kg pow ñ2.
517.Weight of the object on the moon = (1/6) ◊ its weight on the earth.
518. Net force in a particular direction (thrust) and the force per unit area (pressure).
519.SI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted as Pa. Pressure= Thrust/area.
520.The upward force exerted by the water on the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant force. In fact, all objects experience a force of
       buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid. The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid.
521. Objects of density less than that of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of density greater than that of a liquid sink in the liquid.
522.Unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule (J).
523.The unit of energy is, therefore, the same as that of work, that is, joule (J).
524.Objects in motion possess energy. We call this energy kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed.
525.You transfer energy when you stretch a rubber band. The energy transferred to the band is its potential energy.
526.An object increases its energy when raised through a height. This is because work is done on it against gravity while it is being raised. The energy present in such an object
       is the gravitational potential energy.
527.The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy.
528.Power measures the speed of work done, that is, how fast or slow work is done. Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy.
          Power = work/Time
529.The unit of power is watt [in honour of James Watt (1736 ñ 1819)] having the symbol W.
530.Sound can not travel through vaccume. 
531.If you streach a spring continiously.The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions (C) and the regions where the coils are further apart are called
       rarefactions (R).
532.Sound waves are longitudinal waves.
533.When we drop a pebble in a pond, the waves you see on the water surface is an example of transverse wave.
534.The distance between two consecutive compressions (C) or two consecutive rarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, The wavelength is usually represented by 
        (Greek letter lambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).
535.The SI unit of frequency was named as hertz.
536.Low pitch sound has low frequency and high pitch of sound has high frequency.
537.Soft sound has small amplitude and louder sound has large amplitude.
538.The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels.
539. When the speed of any object exceeds the speed of sound it is said to be travelling at supersonic speed.
540.The audible range of sound for human beings extends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz.
541. Sounds of frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or infrasound.
542. It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes produce low-frequency infrasound before the main shock waves
       begin which possibly alert the animals.
543.Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.
544.Ultrasonic waves are made to reflect from various parts of the heart and form the image of the heart. This technique is called ëechocardiographyí.
545.Ultrasound scanner is an instrument which uses ultrasonic waves for getting images of internal organs of the human body.
546.A doctor may image the patientís organs such as the liver, gall bladder, uterus, kidney, etc. It helps the doctor to detect abnormalities, such as stones in the
       gall bladder and kidney or tumours in different organs. In this technique the ultrasonic waves travel through the tissues of the body and get
       reflected from a region where there is a change of tissue density. These waves are then converted into electrical signals that are used to generate images of the organ. These
        images are then displayed on a monitor or printed on a film. This technique is called ëultrasonographyí.
547.SONAR stands for Sound Navigation And Ranging. Sonar is a device that uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance, direction and speed of underwater objects.
548.The speed of sound depends primarily on the nature and the temperature of the transmitting medium.
549.The persistence of sound in an auditorium is the result of repeated reflections of sound and is called reverberation.
